touchlatency
============

With a machine that moves a stylus in circles, this test lets you compute the touch screen latency. Setup the machine so that it's drawing circles on the screen showing this webpage. The blue dot should follow the stylus (or be underneath it if you have a touchscreen with low latency). Press "calibrate" and wait for the stylus to complete several circles, then press "stop calibrating". A circle should appear which matches the path the stylus is making. Now use the nudge buttons to make the red dot be optically underneath the stylus. The nudge value will be the latency when the dot is centered under the moving stylus.
